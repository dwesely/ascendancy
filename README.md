Ascendancy is a turn-based strategy PC game from the 1990s. One aspect of the game is incremental research. This tool lets the user search for items or research fields and provides the required fields to enable the desired item.

To see the research fields required, enter a desired item or research field in one of the text fields. You can then adjust the slider to change the research rate, so you can get a sense of how long it will take to complete each research item. When you complete a research field, you can click on it to indicate the completion, and it will be removed from the list. If you get a research completion that is further down in the path and negates the need for intermediate research fields (e.g. through a xeno dig), the intermediate fields will be removed from the requirements if when you mark the field completed.
